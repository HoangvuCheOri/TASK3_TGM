Face Detection using Violaâ€“Jones Algorithm and Object Classification project using YOLOv8

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains two object detection projects demonstrating both **classical** and **modern** computer vision approaches:

1. **Violaâ€“Jones Face Detection** â€” a traditional algorithm using Haar cascades and AdaBoost for real-time face detection.  
2. **YOLOv8 Rockâ€“Paperâ€“Scissors Detection** â€” a deep learningâ€“based detector that classifies and counts hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.

Both methods are implemented in **Python**, with **OpenCV** for image handling and **Ultralytics YOLO** for deep learning.

Face Detection using Viola–Jones Algorithm and Object Classification using YOLOv8

## Overview
This repository contains two object detection projects demonstrating both **classical** and **modern** computer vision approaches:

1. **Viola–Jones Face Detection** — a traditional algorithm using Haar cascades and AdaBoost for real-time face detection.  
2. **YOLOv8 Rock–Paper–Scissors Detection** — a deep learning–based detector that classifies and counts hand gestures (rock, paper, scissors) using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model.

Both methods are implemented in **Python**, with **OpenCV** for image handling and **Ultralytics YOLO** for deep learning.
